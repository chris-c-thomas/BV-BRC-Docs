Transcriptomics
===============

BV-BRC provides large collection of manually curated transcriptomics datasets, which are collected from publications and NCBI GEO database. Our manual curation process includes a review of the experiment description and the related publication to understand experimental design; combines data from replicates; and creates pair-wise comparisons or contrasts as described in the publication to identify differential gene expression, data normalization and log-transformation. Available analyses consist of a suite of integrated tools to explore, visualize and compare a large number of published transcriptomics datasets.

In addition, BV-bacterial also allows researchers to upload and analyze their own gene expression data in their private workspace and compare it to public datasets.

Accessing Transcriptomics Data
------------------------------

Public transcriptomics datasets are accessible from the "Transcriptomics" Tab available at the taxon, genome and gene levels.
